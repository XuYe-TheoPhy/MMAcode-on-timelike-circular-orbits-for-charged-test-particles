# Mathematica code on timelike circular orbits for charged test particles

This repository contains the mathematica code that can demonstrate the mainly results shown in the paper "Novel topological phenomena of timelike circular orbits for charged test particles". The arxiv number of this paper is [2406.13270](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13270).

Note that the calculation of chapter 3 is simply the special case of chapter 2 via imposing the RN metric.
